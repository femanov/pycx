<h1>sdchan class</h1>
Inheritance chain: cda_object -> cda_base_chan -> cda_sigbase_chan -> sdchan <br>
<BR>
This class is single double value performance optimised channel.<BR>
Instances of this class registers required cda events to track time/value of
selected control system channel. You can get information about channel trough it's properties.
All the properties are readonly. It's an error if you try to assign properties
If you need a notifications use instance signals.


properties:<br>
inherited:<br>
int max_nelems - max number of elements = 1<br>
cda_dataref_t ref - cda channel's id<br>
cxdtype_t dtype - cx data type<br>
str name - channel name (not full)<br>
object context - context<br>
int64 time - server-provided time of last value, us from UNIX epoch<br>
int64 prev_time - server-provided time of preveous value, us from UNIX epoch<br>
size_t itemsize - value size, bytes<br>
<br>
self-defined:<br>
double val - last-known value<br>
double prev_val - preveous value<br>
double tolerance - channel tolerance<br>
<br>
Methods:<br>
setValue(double value) - request to set channel value<br>
setTolerance(double new_tolerance) - set channel change Tolerance,
if abs(val - prev_val) > tolerance then value changed.<br>
<br>
Signals:<br>
valueMeasured(self) - emitted when new value arrived<br>
valueChanged(self) - emitted when value changed<br>
<br>
Signals can be cda_signal or pyqtSignal depending on what you use pycda or cda.<br>
sdchan don't inherit Qobject in qcda, encapsulation is used to bring pyqtSignals to
channel-like classes. Instance that emitted a signal will be passed as only argument to
connected functions.<br>
Double in methods means that what ever you give will be casted to double.
If it's not possible it's an error.
